            <h2 class = "subtitle">The Idea</h2>
            <p>I like roly polies, and I like making costumes, so I decided to make a roly poly costume. Wearing a really cool homemade costume is fun,
            because you get a moderate degree of positive attention. I found an instructable on how to make the costume. The instructions seemed tedious but simple enough. This was their result and my end goal:</p>

            <h2 class = "subtitle">The Process</h2>
            <p>The first step was to paper mache an exercise ball with 3 layers of paper mache. SEVEN TIMES:</p>
            <img src = "images/papermache.jpg" alt = "paper mache process">
            <p>I cut those balls into segments and painted them:</p>
            <img src = "images/paint.jpg" alt = "spray paint everywhere">
            <p>Then I hit a problem. The instructions didn't really cover how to attach the segments to the plastic pipe that served as the backbone for the costume. I had to get creative:</p>
            <img src = "images/plans.jpg" alt = "my plans">
            <p>There was much frustration involved, but eventually I got it worked out:</p>
            <img src = "images/construct.jpg" alt = "It was a relief when it worked">
            <h2 class = "subtitle">The Result</h2>
            <p>I have to admit that the end result looked pretty cool. I wore it to a show and got lots of compliments. The only downside was that I couldn't really see out of it.</p>
            <img src = "images/result.jpg" alt = "the finished product">
            <p>After this, I had to take a break from making stuff. My husband insisted that I observe a "no project November," which has been nice! 
                But now that it's December, it's time to make myself busy with my foolishly ambitious plan for our Christmas card...</p>
